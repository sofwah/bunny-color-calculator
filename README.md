# Bunny Color Calculator

## Overview

This React project is a simple bunny color calculator that helps determine the potential colors of bunny offspring based on the colors of their parents. It uses genetic principles to predict the color outcomes and provides a visually appealing interface for users to explore various combinations. The gene codes are currently only displayed in the German standard.

## Features

- **Parental Input:** Users can input the colors of both bunny parents using a color picker or by entering gene codes.

- **Color Prediction:** The application calculates and displays the possible color outcomes for the offspring based on the genetic combinations of the parent colors.
